# Symbols

=begin  
Symbols are like strings, except they are code.  
- Have better performance than strings  
- Takes less memory than strings  
- unique copy  
- immutable  
# Symbols save memory because Ruby doesn't create new copies every time! üéØ

Useful as keys mainly

actors = {  
    :tom_cruise => "Mission Impossible",

    :dev_patel => "Hotel Mumbai"  
}

# Symbols = Permanent Name Tags üè∑Ô∏è
# Think of symbols as permanent labels that never change:
# ruby
# # Symbols - Fixed labels
# :name      # ‚Üê This label always means "name"
# :age       # ‚Üê This label always means "age" 
# :email     # ‚Üê This label always means "email"
# Strings = Disposable Paper Notes üìù
# ruby
# # Strings - Temporary notes
# "name"     # ‚Üê New paper with "name" written
# "name"     # ‚Üê Another new paper with "name" written  
# Real Example:
# ruby
# # Using SYMBOLS (efficient)
# person = {
#   :name => "John",    # ‚Üê Reuses the :name label
#   :age => 25          # ‚Üê Reuses the :age label
# }

# # Using STRINGS (less efficient)  
# person = {
#   "name" => "John",   # ‚Üê Creates new "name" paper
#   "age" => 25         # ‚Üê Creates new "age" paper
# }
# Simple Rule:
# Use Symbols for things that DON'T change (keys, method names)

# Use Strings for things that DO change (user input, messages)
